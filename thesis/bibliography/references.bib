We focus on the role of these advanced technologies in enhancing Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) and promoting sustainable farming practices. The paper provides a comprehensive review of how IoT, Big Data, and AI can be combined to monitor carbon footprints and support broader sustainability objectives in agriculture. As a key contribution, we propose a feasible, end-to-end system architecture tailored to the assessment of carbon footprint, combining IoT-enabled sensing, real-time data analytics, and predictive modeling. This study highlights the tangible benefits of these technologies through real-world case studies and evaluates their effectiveness in improving emission monitoring, operational efficiency, and environmental compliance. Furthermore, challenges such as data interoperability, device energy efficiency, and implementation costs are critically analyzed, providing insights into existing research gaps. The paper also identifies future directions, including scalable IoT-based carbon markets, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for precision agriculture, and blockchain solutions for transparent carbon credit trading. The goal is to offer actionable insights into the adoption of cutting-edge technologies to achieve carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability in the agriculture sector.}

abstract = {The agriculture industry is undergoing a rapid digital transformation and is growing powerful by the pillars of cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and allied technologies. At the core of artificial intelligence, deep learning-based computer vision enables various agriculture activities to be performed automatically with utmost precision enabling smart agriculture into reality. Computer vision techniques, in conjunction with high-quality image acquisition using remote cameras, enable non-contact and efficient technology-driven solutions in agriculture. This review contributes to providing state-of-the-art computer vision technologies based on deep learning that can assist farmers in operations starting from land preparation to harvesting. Recent works in the area of computer vision were analyzed in this paper and categorized into (a) seed quality analysis, (b) soil analysis, (c) irrigation water management, (d) plant health analysis, (e) weed management (f) livestock management and (g) yield estimation. The paper also discusses recent trends in computer vision such as generative adversarial networks (GAN), vision transformers (ViT) and other popular deep learning architectures. Additionally, this study pinpoints the challenges in implementing the solutions in the farmer's field in real-time. The overall finding indicates that convolutional neural networks are the corner stone of modern computer vision approaches and their various architectures provide high-quality solutions across various agriculture activities in terms of precision and accuracy. However, the success of the computer vision approach lies in building the model on a quality dataset and providing real-time solutions.}

abstract = {Fruit cracking is a persistent challenge for table grape growing. To investigate the mechanism of this disorder, a comprehensive two-year investigation was conducted to assess the fruit cracking percentage of 15 table grape (Vitis vinifera L.) varieties. Based on the findings, the cracking-susceptible variety 'Xiangfei' and the cracking-resistant variety 'Zuijinxiang' were selected for further study. Fruit growth curves for 'Zuijinxiang' and 'Xiangfei' were plotted based on fruit diameter and total soluble solids content, revealing that both varieties exhibited typical double-sigmoidal patterns that were highly similar. The period between 48 and 53 days after full bloom (DAFB) was identified as the critical phase for fruit cracking incidence. Furthermore, during the fruit cracking period, 'Xiangfei' fruit exhibited significantly higher water content and mesocarp cell area compared with those of 'Zuijinxiang'. Applying aquaporin inhibitors (nano-silver) to 'Xiangfei' berries reduced fruit water uptake and cracking percentage, whereas applying aquaporin activators (forskolin) to 'Zuijinxiang' berries increased fruit water uptake and cracking percentage. Additionally, expression analysis of six genes associated with plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs) synthesis (VvPIP1;1, VvPIP1;2, VvPIP1;3, VvPIP2;1, VvPIP2;2, and VvPIP2;3) revealed that only the expression level of VvPIP1;1 was higher in 'Zuijinxiang' than in 'Xiangfei' during the fruit cracking period, whereas the expression levels of the other genes exhibited no significant difference between the two varieties. Transgenic overexpression of VvPIP1;1 in tomato resulted in increased fruit water content, enlarged mesocarp cell size, and enhanced fruit cracking percentage. These findings indicate that VvPIP1;1 plays a pivotal role in controlling grape berry cracking.}

ABSTRACT = {Table grape viticulture, due to the impact of climate change, will have to face many challenges in the coming decades, including resistance to pathogens and physiological disorders. Our attention was focused on fruit cracking due to its ubiquitous presence in several species. This study explores the effects of three different treatments on the epidermis and cuticle of table grape berries by evaluating the impact of the girdling technique on various fruit quality parameters, including cuticle thickness, sugar content, acidity, color, bunch weight, and rheological properties. The treatments were (1) calcium chloride (CaCl2), (2) calcium chloride + salicylic acid (CaCl2 + SA), and (3) calcium chloride + Ascophyllum nodosum (CaCl2 + AN), with and without girdling, plus an untreated control. This research was conducted over the 2021–2022 growing season in a commercial vineyard in Licodia Eubea, Sicily, Italy. The results indicate significant variations in cuticle thickness and other qualitative traits throughout the growth and ripening phases, with notable differences depending on the treatment used. This study's findings suggest that specific treatments can influence the structural integrity of the grape cuticle, potentially impacting the fruit's susceptibility to cracking and overall marketability. The findings provide valuable insights into the role of chemical treatments and cultural techniques in enhancing fruit quality and resistance to environmental stresses in table grape cultivation.},

ABSTRACT = {Table grapes suffer significant losses due to issues such as fungal infections, cracking, and berry shattering, which affect them both in the vineyard during ripening and throughout postharvest storage. Current control methods, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) treatments, are increasingly constrained by potential fruit damage and regulatory limitations, prompting a search for sustainable alternatives. This comprehensive review synthesizes the current scientific understanding and recent studies regarding calcium dynamics and proposes sorbitol as an innovative preharvest solution to enhance table grape quality through improved calcium (Ca) transport. Ca is a vital macronutrient for cell wall integrity and fruit resistance; however, its inherent low mobility in the phloem restricts its effective delivery to developing fruits, particularly after the veraison stage. This review thoroughly discusses the mechanistic hypotheses by which sorbitol, a naturally occurring sugar-alcohol, acts as a "vector" by forming stable, soluble complexes with Ca, thereby facilitating its crucial translocation to fruit tissues. Preharvest foliar applications of these calcium-sorbitol complexes have demonstrated numerous benefits, improving fruit firmness, reducing the incidence of cracking and shattering, mitigating fungal decay, and boosting antioxidant activity. These effects collectively enhance overall fruit quality and extend storability. Finally, we outline future directions for investigation, aiming to further clarify the molecular mechanisms involved and explore the potential of sorbitol to form complexes with other poorly mobile nutrients and plant elicitors, opening new avenues for sustainable crop management.},

The cultivar 'BRS Núbia' (Vitis vinifera L. x Vitis labrusca L.) is a promising alternative; however, its phenological behavior, thermal requirements, and compatibility with different rootstocks under subtropical conditions require further evaluation. This study aimed to assess the duration of phenological stages, thermal requirement, and ripening dynamics of 'BRS Núbia' grapevines grafted onto the rootstocks 'IAC 572 Jales', 'IAC 766 Campinas', and 'Paulsen 1103'. The experiment was conducted in São Manuel, São Paulo, Brazil during the 2021 and 2022 production cycles using a split-plot experimental design (3 × 2). Evaluations included the duration of phenological stages from pruning to budburst, flowering, fruit set, onset of ripening, and harvest, as well as the ripening curve and thermal accumulation from pruning to harvest. Rootstocks did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) the duration of phenological stages; however, differences were observed between production cycles. The 2022 cycle was longer (167.7 days) compared to 2021 (142.6 days), with greater thermal accumulation (1871.7 GDDs vs. 1743.4 GDDs). The analysis of phenological stages revealed that, across both production cycles evaluated, the 'BRS Núbia' cultivar required an average accumulation of 1807.5 growing degree days from pruning to harvest. Soluble solids content ranged from 17.43 to 18.50°Brix, and titratable acidity decreased throughout maturation. The maturation index was highest in vines grafted onto 'Paulsen 1103', indicating its positive influence on fruit quality. The 'BRS Núbia' grapevine exhibited a mean thermal requirement of 1807.5 growing degree days (GDDs) to complete its phenological cycle, which lasted approximately 150 days under subtropical conditions.}, DOI = {10.3390/horticulturae11050466} }

This review offers a comprehensive analysis of current and emerging preservation strategies—including chemical fumigation, irradiation, packaging technologies, controlled-atmosphere (CA) storage, biodegradable coatings, and synergistic preservation systems. Distinct from prior studies that typically emphasize specific techniques or treatment categories, this work integrates mechanistic insights with technological advancements and industrial practices across multiple preservation modalities. It further evaluates the comparative effectiveness, limitations, and practical relevance of these strategies along the supply chain. Importantly, it identifies critical research gaps—such as the lack of cultivar-specific preservation protocols, the need for low-residue and environmentally sustainable treatments, and the absence of real-time quality monitoring systems. Addressing these gaps is essential for developing next-generation solutions. Finally, this review highlights practical implications by offering a forward-looking framework to guide innovation, providing grape producers and supply chain stakeholders with strategies to minimize losses, preserve quality, and enhance market competitiveness.}, DOI = {10.3390/plants14162462} }

  abstract = {Although the optimal storage conditions for grapes are well-established, deviations can occur in commercial settings. Our goal was to study the extent to which these deviations will affect grape properties, and if this can be effectively modeled. In the first year, we focused on how constant temperature shifts affect grape properties; in the second, on how temperature interruptions in the first period of storage influence fruit quality. The main features quantified were weight loss, rachis browning, decay, firmness, bleaching, and cracking. With respect to a 2\% threshold of decay, 0~\textdegree C enabled storage for 9 weeks, 3~\textdegree C for 6 weeks, and 6~\textdegree C for 3 weeks, all plus 3 d of shelf life, suggesting that storage temperature can be modified according to storage duration. Notably, temperature interruptions in the initial storage period demonstrated that the temperature of the interruption has a more significant impact on fruit quality than the duration of the interruption, particularly for weight loss and decay. Feature-importance analysis identified storage time as the primary factor influencing postharvest quality, but it highlighted the role of additional features as well. Dynamic models such as XGBoost consistently outperformed linear regression models in predicting both acceptance and rachis browning scores, but the latter had better R2 values. Results suggest that deviations from optimal storage conditions should be considered in future quality predictions and logistics management of grapes.}

ABSTRACT = {Pears (Pyrus (Rosaceae, Pyrinae) are among the oldest plants cultivated by humans and the second most widely grown fruit worldwide, after apples. They are commercially important fruit trees; over the last few decades, global area, production, and exports have massively increased. However, fruit cracking at an early stage or at maturity is a severe physiological disorder, causing significant economic losses to pear growers. Fruit cracking may be associated with inadequate irrigation, environmental factors, and nutritional deficiencies, particularly those involving B, Ca, Zn, and potash. Fruits can crack during growth and development due to the abrupt temperature changes between day and night, water imbalances, sun exposure, trellis systems, and the color of the fruit packaging. Cracking is more pronounced when the fruit has reached maturity, and no single factor is known to effectively prevent its occurrence. Although fruit cracking poses the risk of great economic losses, research on its cause and management in pears is limited as compared to other fruit crops. Therefore, examining the occurrence of pear fruit cracking in relation to cultivar genetics, fruit composition and quality, the water levels of the soil and water uptake by plants, and the role of micronutrients and plant growth regulators will aid in the development of strategies to reduce fruit cracking in pears. This review briefly summarizes the causes of fruit cracking in pears and possible control strategies.},

ABSTRACT = {Peel cracking and ostiole-end splitting (collectively termed cracking) are common disorders in ripe fig fruit, downgrading fruit quality and thus limiting marketability. This two-year field study addressed the possibility of alleviating cracking at harvest by two foliar salicylic acid (SA) sprays prior to harvest (8 and 5 d). Three SA concentrations (0, 1, and 2 mM) were employed in the first year, and based on the obtained results two (0 and 2 mM) in the second year. A local variety ('Vasilika') with excellent organoleptic profile, and high sensitivity to cracking was evaluated. Fruit was harvested at commercial maturity. Fruit marketability was mainly based on the incidence and severity of cracking. Fruit weight, peel color, flesh total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and pH were estimated for fig quality. The contents of total anthocyanins (TAN), cyanidin-3-rutinoside (c-3-rut; the major anthocyanin in fig), and the expression of four genes coding for regulatory enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia lyase, anthocyanidin synthase, UDP-flavonoid glucosyl transferase 1, and UDP-flavonoid glucosyl transferase 2) of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway were also determined in the peel. Preharvest SA application (2 mM) increased the percentage of fruit without cracking (sound fruit) by 1.4–2.6-fold, and of marketable fruit (sound and slightly cracked) by 2-fold. SA application (2 mM) was associated with increased flesh TSS and TA, as well as with decreased flesh pH and peel red coloration in stripe. The treatment (2 mM SA) decreased both TAN and c-3-rut contents, which were highly associated (r = 0.978). Responses of transcription level of the four genes to SA application varied, and did not correlate with the other variables in the study. In conclusion, SA appears to be a low-cost and environmentally-safe agent for improving fig fruit quality and marketability, and facilitates harvesting and postharvest management of figs.},

abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a robust data-analysis and image-processing technique that has shown great promise in the agricultural sector. In this study, 129 papers that are based on DL applications used in agriculture are discussed, categorizing them into five areas: crop yield prediction, plant stress detection, weed and pest detection, disease detection, and smart farming. Smart farming is sub-categorized as water management, seed analysis, and soil analysis. This study highlights the potential of deep learning in enhancing agricultural productivity and promoting economic growth. The study found that supervised learning networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), AlexNet, and ResNet, are primarily used in agriculture to enhance economic growth. However, there is a need to develop new DL techniques that can improve model performance and reduce inference time for practical applications. In this review, critical research gaps, particularly in the development of new techniques, are analyzed. This study emphasizes the importance of continued research in this area to fully leverage DL's potential of DL for smart farming and to achieve sustainable agricultural development.}
