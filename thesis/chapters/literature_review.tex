\chapter{Literature Review}

\section{Grape Cracking as an Agricultural and Physiological Problem}

\subsection{Definition and visual manifestation of fruit cracking}


Fruit cracking in table grapes (\textit{Vitis vinifera} L.) is defined as a physiological disorder in which the berry skin ruptures, compromising fruit quality and marketability \parencite{horticulturae11111320}.
The visible manifestation typically appears as surface splits or fissures on the berry, reflecting the mechanical failure of the cuticle--skin system under stress \parencite{plants13172400}. 
Recent physiological evidence further links cracking susceptibility to cultivar-dependent differences in water uptake and internal tissue expansion during critical developmental phases \parencite{YU20251506}.


\subsection{Phenological timing (veraison, late ripening stages)}

\noindent
The phenological development of grape berries is characterized by well-defined stages that culminate in ripening, with veraison representing a critical transition point from berry growth to maturation. Veraison marks the onset of ripening and is associated with coordinated physiological changes, including berry softening, shifts in water and solute transport, and the initiation of biochemical processes that define fruit quality \parencite{horticulturae11111320}. The timing and duration of veraison and subsequent late ripening stages are strongly influenced by thermal accumulation and environmental conditions, leading to variability in ripening dynamics across seasons and cultivars. Recent phenological studies have demonstrated that growing degree days (GDD) provide a robust framework for describing the progression from veraison to harvest, with differences in heat accumulation directly affecting the length of late ripening stages and final harvest timing \parencite{horticulturae11050466}.


\subsection{Environmental and agronomic triggers}

\noindent
Environmental and agronomic factors play a central role in modulating grape berry development and triggering physiological disorders during ripening, particularly under conditions of altered water availability and tissue hydration. Variations in water uptake driven by aquaporin activity have been shown to directly influence internal berry pressure and cracking susceptibility \parencite{YU20251506}, while changes in cuticle structure and integrity during ripening modulate the berry’s mechanical resistance to environmental stress \parencite{plants13172400}. In parallel, agronomic practices affecting calcium transport and availability after veraison further influence fruit firmness and skin stability, thereby impacting the berry’s response to environmental stressors during late ripening stages \parencite{horticulturae11111320}.



\section{Economic Impact and Practical Consequences}

\subsection{Yield losses and reduction in marketable produce}

\noindent
Fruit cracking leads to substantial yield losses in table grape production by directly reducing the proportion of berries suitable for fresh market commercialization. Even limited cracking of the berry skin is sufficient to render fruit unmarketable, as it compromises visual quality and accelerates postharvest deterioration processes such as water loss, tissue softening, and increased susceptibility to decay \parencite{plants14162462}. As a result, a significant discrepancy often emerges between biological yield and effective marketable yield, particularly in commercial vineyards exposed to unfavorable conditions during ripening. Based on large-scale production and economic estimates, cracking-related losses in table grapes can reach approximately €175 million, assuming a 25\% yield loss rate, an average production volume of 280~kt, and a mean market price of 2.5~€/kg \parencite{CrackSense2022}. At a broader scale, fruit cracking is recognized as a major physiological disorder that contributes to yield instability and economic loss across multiple fruit crops, including grapes, by increasing preharvest rejection rates and postharvest waste \parencite{santos2023molecular}.



\subsection{Quality degradation and shelf-life reduction}

\noindent
Reactive or purely reactive management strategies for fruit cracking have shown limited effectiveness in table grape production, where berry susceptibility is strongly governed by the interaction between environmental conditions during ripening and intrinsic skin and tissue properties. Reviews addressing fruit cracking across fleshy fruit crops emphasize that abrupt changes in water availability, humidity, and temperature frequently exceed the buffering capacity of short-term corrective interventions once berries reach vulnerable developmental stages, rendering post-hoc management largely insufficient \parencite{agronomy12102437,xu2025overview}. In grapes, even minor cracking events are sufficient to compromise marketability, which further amplifies the economic consequences of delayed or reactive responses. Evidence from field-based mitigation studies in other thin-skinned fruits indicates that targeted preharvest treatments, such as salicylic acid sprays, can reduce cracking incidence but do not eliminate it, suggesting that similar reactive approaches in grapes are inherently constrained and highly dependent on timing and environmental context \parencite{app112311374}. Collectively, these findings highlight the limitations of reactive management strategies in table grapes and underscore the need for preventive, monitoring-driven, and proactive approaches to cracking risk mitigation.


\subsection{Limitations of reactive management strategies}

\noindent
Reactive or purely reactive management strategies for berry cracking in table grapes remain inherently limited, largely because cracking is triggered by rapid shifts in water relations and microclimatic conditions during ripening, interacting with cultivar-specific skin and cuticle properties. Evidence from table-grape studies indicates that cracking susceptibility is tightly linked to berry structural integrity and water uptake dynamics, with critical windows during ripening in which short-term corrective actions may be insufficient to prevent splitting once mechanical resistance declines \parencite{Chang2019,Chang2021,YU20251506}. Accordingly, while preharvest interventions aimed at strengthening the cuticle or improving tissue integrity (e.g., calcium-based or combined treatments) can contribute to improved berry skin traits and potentially reduce susceptibility, their effectiveness is typically partial and context-dependent rather than fully preventive \parencite{plants13172400}. Taken together, these findings highlight that reactive management alone is unlikely to provide robust control of cracking in commercial table-grape systems and motivate preventive, monitoring-driven, and proactive strategies that enable earlier risk identification and timely intervention \parencite{CrackSense2022}.




\section{Physiological and Biomechanical Mechanisms of Grape Cracking}

\noindent
Reactive or purely reactive management strategies for fruit cracking have consistently demonstrated limited efficacy across diverse horticultural crops. Comprehensive reviews indicate that cracking is driven by complex interactions between environmental triggers—such as rainfall, humidity fluctuations, and abrupt temperature changes—and intrinsic physiological and structural fruit properties, which often overwhelm short-term or corrective interventions applied after stress exposure \parencite{agronomy12102437,xu2025overview}. As emphasized in these studies, no single management practice is capable of fully preventing cracking once susceptible developmental stages are reached, underscoring the inherent limitations of post-hoc approaches and the need for preventive, integrated strategies. Field-based intervention trials further support this conclusion: although targeted preharvest treatments such as foliar salicylic acid applications can significantly reduce cracking incidence and improve marketable yield, their effectiveness remains partial and crop- and condition-dependent, highlighting fundamental constraints of reactive measures when applied in isolation \parencite{app112311374}.


\subsection{Berry water relations and turgor pressure dynamics}

\noindent
Beyond softening, water uptake plays a central role. Even minor fluctuations in soil moisture or
surface wetness can cause rapid increases in berry volume. When mesocarp expansion outpaces
the extensibility of the skin, tensile stress accumulates in the cuticle and epidermal cell walls.
As reviewed by Khadivi-Khub \cite{Khadivi2014}, this imbalance—driven by osmotic gradients,
turgor dynamics, and altered permeability—forms a generalized mechanism for cracking across
thin-skinned fruit species. However, grapes are particularly sensitive because cuticular deposition slows
near maturity, while mesocarp growth continues. This mismatch in developmental timing reduces the
elastic reserve of the skin and predisposes berries to micro-fissuring and eventual rupture.

\subsection{Cuticle structure, micro-cracks, and mechanical failure}

\noindent
The grape berry cuticle functions as both a diffusion barrier and mechanical shell.
Its composition—cutin, polysaccharides, and epicuticular waxes—determines the skin’s tensile strength,
elasticity, and hydration behavior. Studies in sweet cherry and tomato have demonstrated that
microcracks in the cuticle dramatically increase water permeability and serve as initiation sites for
macroscopic cracking \cite{Peschel2005,Emmons1998}. Recent work now shows that grapes exhibit similar
patterns. Chang and Keller \cite{Chang2021} revealed that the grape cuticle and epidermal cell walls play
both overlapping and distinct roles in resisting cracking. Their microscopy studies indicate that
microcracks can form days before visible splitting and propagate through weakened regions of the cuticle
under mechanical stress or hydration events.

\medskip
\noindent
Environmental conditions exacerbate these mechanical vulnerabilities. High humidity, rain, or dew
hydration increases cuticular permeability and reduces its fracture toughness. Conversely, heat and
drought can cause structural fatigue through repeated cycles of dehydration and rehydration.
Because these microcracks do not manifest visually, early detection requires sensitive optical or
spectral tools—highlighting the relevance of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) approaches.

\subsection{Hormonal influences and agronomic interventions}

\noindent
Plant growth regulators, particularly gibberellins, are widely applied in table grape production to
increase berry size, reduce compactness, and improve market quality. However, these treatments also
modify skin biomechanics. Lichter et al. \cite{Lichter2014} investigated the effects of GA\textsubscript{3}
on the seeded table grape ‘Zainy’ and found that while berry enlargement was achieved, the
treatment altered skin structure and significantly affected cracking susceptibility.
Their findings highlight the trade-off between agronomic optimization and physiological stability,
emphasizing the need for cultivar-specific GA\textsubscript{3} protocols.

\medskip
\noindent
Other hormones—most notably abscisic acid (ABA)—also shape berry softening and water transport.
Castellarin et al. \cite{Castellarin2016} characterized the interplay between ABA metabolism, turgor loss,
and cell wall modification during ripening. These hormonal signals regulate both mesocarp softness and
cuticle extensibility, indirectly influencing cracking risk. Together, these works suggest that cracking is not
only mechanically driven but is also hormonally modulated.

\subsection{Cultivar-dependent susceptibility and variability}

\noindent
Cracking susceptibility varies widely among grape cultivars, reflecting differences in cuticle thickness,
cell wall architecture, berry firmness, water relations, and patterns of sugar accumulation.
Chang and Keller \cite{Chang2021} demonstrated cultivar-dependent variation in skin biomechanical
properties, showing that small differences in cuticle thickness or epidermal morphology can translate into
large differences in cracking rates. Thin-cuticle cultivars or those with rapid sugar accumulation during ripening
tend to be more vulnerable.



\medskip
\noindent
For ‘Scarlotta Seedless’, the cultivar investigated in the present study, several postharvest evaluations
have documented sensitivity to temperature fluctuations and hydration-induced damage
\cite{Scarlotta2024,Scarlotta2022}. While these works focus primarily on postharvest quality, they provide
important evidence that the skin of Scarlotta berries is structurally fragile compared to other table grape
varieties. Given the cultivar’s widespread commercial use, understanding and detecting early signs of
cuticular stress is a significant applied challenge.

\subsection{Skin pathology as an indicator of structural instability}

\noindent
Although not a cracking disorder per se, grape sour rot provides insight into skin structural failure.
Hall et al. \cite{Hall2018} demonstrated that sour rot development is strongly associated with breaches
in berry skin integrity, allowing entry of yeasts, acetic acid bacteria, and insects. These findings reinforce
the broader concept that once the cuticle–epidermis barrier is compromised—whether by microcracks,
overripening, or mechanical abrasion—the fruit becomes highly vulnerable to physiological and
pathological deterioration. Thus, the onset of cracking represents a pivotal point of failure in grape
berry biology.

\subsection{Summary}

\noindent
Overall, grape cracking emerges from the interaction of mechanical constraints,
hormonal regulation, developmental processes, and cultivar-specific structural traits.
Although these mechanisms have been extensively investigated, most studies focus on
visible or post-symptomatic cracking stages. Consequently, early pre-symptomatic
structural and physiological changes in the berry skin remain poorly characterized,
highlighting the need for non-destructive optical approaches such as hyperspectral
imaging.




\section{Precision Agriculture and Non-Destructive Sensing}

\subsection{Principles of precision agriculture and data-driven crop management}

\noindent
Precision agriculture (PA) has emerged as a data-driven management paradigm that seeks to optimize agricultural operations through the integration of sensing technologies, data analytics, and site-specific interventions. At its core, PA relies on systematic acquisition and analysis of large heterogeneous datasets to improve efficiency, productivity, and long-term sustainability in crop production \cite{mgendi2024unlocking}. Recent advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data infrastructures, and artificial intelligence (AI) have further accelerated the adoption of data-centric farming practices, enabling continuous environmental monitoring and facilitating sustainable resource management at multiple spatial and temporal scales \cite{AHMED2025100848}.

\subsection{Role of proximal and remote sensing technologies}

\noindent
The proliferation of smart sensor technologies—including proximal sensing devices, wireless sensor networks, and real-time monitoring platforms—has substantially expanded the types of agronomic variables that can be measured in situ. Such sensors now capture environmental, physiological, and operational parameters with unprecedented resolution, which supports precise and resource-efficient crop management \cite{soussi2024smart}.

\subsection{Limitations of conventional physiological measurements}

\noindent
Managing these heterogeneous datasets—which often vary in granularity, modality, and update frequency—requires robust data engineering pipelines capable of processing information across various temporal and spatial dimensions. This complexity is further amplified by the need to deliver decision-ready outputs in formats that support real-time or near-real-time analysis \cite{krisnawijaya2022data}. To address these challenges, modern PA increasingly incorporates advanced computational methods, including big data platforms, data-driven modeling, and AI-driven analytics. These tools play a key role in transforming raw sensor data into actionable insights, allowing early detection of anomalies, improved planning, and automated decision-support workflows \cite{mgendi2024unlocking, AHMED2025100848}.

\subsection{Computer Vision and AI in Agriculture}
\label{subsec:cv_ai_agriculture}

\noindent
Computer vision (CV) and AI have become central tools in precision agriculture, enabling automated monitoring and decision support across tasks such as plant health assessment, weed mapping, defect detection, and yield estimation \cite{tian2020computer, patricio2018computer, DHANYA2022211, cao2025review}. In recent years, deep-learning architectures (e.g., CNNs and related variants) have dominated these applications due to their capacity to learn rich visual representations under diverse conditions \cite{benos2021machine, ATTRI2023102217, ghazal2024computer}.

\medskip
\noindent
However, the agricultural domain poses persistent data constraints that are particularly acute for pixel-level tasks (e.g., segmentation). Reviews consistently note that model performance and generalization hinge on dataset representativeness and annotation quality, both of which are difficult to guarantee under field variability (illumination changes, occlusions, phenological shifts, and heterogeneous backgrounds) \cite{tian2020computer, patricio2018computer, benos2021machine, DHANYA2022211}. These limitations motivate complementary sensing modalities and learning paradigms that reduce dependence on dense manual labeling, and they contextualize why hyperspectral workflows often prioritize robust preprocessing, classical machine learning, and aggregation strategies when targeting early and field-relevant inference.

\section{Hyperspectral Imaging for Agricultural Applications}

\subsection{Fundamentals of Reflectance and Spectral Signatures}
\label{sec:reflectance_fundamentals}

\noindent
A central concept in spectral analysis is reflectance, defined as the ratio between the radiation reflected by a surface and the radiation received by that surface. This ratio is influenced by the material's chemical properties, surface micro-topography, and the angle of the light source \cite{blackburn2007}. Reflectance is the primary value captured at each pixel for every wavelength in a hyperspectral image, providing a normalized measure that is independent of the illumination intensity.

\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:reflectance_formula} formalizes this normalization, highlighting why reflectance (rather than raw radiance) is the appropriate unit for comparing spectra across field acquisitions with changing illumination.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/literature/reflectence_furmula.jpg}
\caption{The formula for reflectance \cite{blackburn2007}.}
\label{fig:reflectance_formula}
\end{figure}

\medskip
\noindent
When a material is exposed to a light source, it reflects specific portions of electromagnetic energy according to its molecular vibrations and chemical composition. This unique reaction is known as the spectral signature of a material \cite{shaw2002}. Because these signatures are specific to chemical structures, hyperspectral imaging enables reliable discrimination between visually similar targets that would otherwise appear identical under conventional RGB or multispectral sensors. 

\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:barley_signature} provides a concrete example of this principle: moisture changes produce systematic, wavelength-dependent signature shifts, illustrating why HSI can detect physiological and structural changes before they are visually apparent.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/literature/Barley_Signature.jpg}
\caption{Hyperspectral signature of barley grains with varying moisture content \cite{sun2020}.}
\label{fig:barley_signature}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spectral Imaging Modalities and the Electromagnetic Spectrum}

\noindent
Imaging systems differ substantially in the density and breadth of the spectral information they capture. Traditional RGB cameras record reflected light using only three broad bands of visible radiation: blue, green, and red \cite{benelli2020hyperspectral}. Multispectral imaging (MSI) typically expands this capability by capturing between 3 to 15 distinct bands and has a spectral resolution greater than 10 nm. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) acquires reflectance data across hundreds of narrow, contiguous spectral bands, typically with a spectral resolution of less than 5 nm \cite{Mehta2018}.


\medskip
\noindent
These systems capture broad segments of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from the ultraviolet (UV) around 200 nm, through the visible (VIS) light range (380 nm to 800 nm), and extending into the near-infrared (NIR) up to 1700 nm \cite{ball2007field}. Additionally, the range often includes the short-wave infrared (SWIR) from 970 nm to 2500 nm \cite{ball2007field, Zwinkels2015}. This high spectral resolution results in a three-dimensional hyperspectral data cube where each spatial pixel is associated with a detailed spectral vector, enabling the detection of both surface and subsurface characteristics that are not visible through conventional imaging \cite{hong2025hyperspectralimaging}.

\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:wavelength_regions} situates the VIS--NIR range used in this thesis within the broader electromagnetic spectrum, underscoring that the selected bands capture both pigment-driven VIS variability and structure/water-driven NIR variability.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Advantages of Hyperspectral Imaging over RGB Imaging}

\noindent
Hyperspectral imaging offers substantial advantages over conventional RGB imaging by capturing detailed spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths. While RGB imaging provides only coarse color-based information, HSI records a dense spectral signature for each pixel, enabling precise characterization of material composition and condition \cite{Specim2024Guide}. This enhanced spectral resolution allows HSI to detect subtle biochemical, structural, and physicochemical variations that are often indistinguishable in RGB images \cite{agriculture15161775, foods14172977}.

\medskip
\noindent
In agricultural and food-related applications, HSI has demonstrated clear superiority over RGB imaging in tasks such as disease detection, quality assessment, and safety monitoring, owing to its ability to integrate spatial and spectral information in a non-destructive manner \cite{agriculture15161775, foods14172977}. This capability facilitates the identification of pre-visual physiological stress, such as moisture imbalances or cell wall degradation, which often occur before physical symptoms like grape cracking become visible to the naked eye \cite{Abade2025SpectrumToYield, Valme2025HSIMobileRobots}.

\subsection{VIS--NIR Sensitivity to Physiological and Structural Changes}

\noindent
The visible and near-infrared (VIS--NIR) spectral range exhibits high sensitivity to physiological and structural changes in plant tissues. Variations in VIS reflectance (400--700 nm) are primarily associated with biochemical components such as photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophyll), whereas NIR reflectance (700--1000 nm) is strongly influenced by internal tissue structure and water-related properties \cite{zhang2022reflectance, wang2024frontiers}.

\medskip
\noindent
Recent studies have demonstrated that VIS--NIR hyperspectral imaging enables the early detection of plant physiological stress prior to the appearance of visible symptoms, highlighting its sensitivity to subtle functional changes at the tissue level \cite{liu2023sensors, Abade2025SpectrumToYield}. In fruit systems, VIS--NIR reflectance has been shown to correlate with internal quality attributes, including structural integrity, sugar content, and water status \cite{sun2024fruit}. These findings establish VIS--NIR HSI as a powerful tool for capturing microstructural and physiological variations that are not discernible using conventional imaging approaches.

\subsection{Applications in Fruit Quality Assessment and Defect Detection}

\noindent
Hyperspectral imaging has been widely investigated as a non-destructive technique for fruit quality assessment and defect detection. Recent studies emphasize that combining HSI with advanced machine learning and deep learning methods enables accurate evaluation of fruit quality attributes and improves food safety monitoring \cite{yang2025jafc, frontiers2024fruit}. The rich spectral signatures captured by HSI facilitate the identification of internal composition and surface characteristics that are not discernible using conventional imaging.


\medskip
\noindent
Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of HSI for detecting both external and internal fruit defects, such as bruises, scars, and disease-related decay \cite{akter2025defects, min2023decay}. In addition, HSI combined with feature selection techniques has shown strong potential for estimating key quality indicators such as soluble solid content (SSC), firmness, and aroma-related attributes in a variety of fruits \cite{zhu2025bagging, tian2023mango, kanwal2025quality}. Overall, these studies establish HSI as a robust framework for postharvest management and industrial sorting, providing significant potential for industrial food safety assurance.

\section{Machine Learning for Hyperspectral Data Analysis}

\subsubsection{Traditional machine learning approaches for hyperspectral imaging}
\label{subsec:traditional_ml_hsi}

\noindent
Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches have been widely adopted for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis in agricultural and food-quality applications, primarily due to their effectiveness in small- to medium-sized datasets and their reliance on well-established spectral preprocessing pipelines. Comprehensive review studies indicate that classical ML methods continue to play a central role in precision agriculture, supporting a broad range of tasks including crop and disease detection, stress monitoring, yield assessment, and produce quality evaluation \cite{RAM2024109037, su16146064}.

\medskip
\noindent
In typical traditional HSI workflows, each sample is represented as a spectral vector extracted at the pixel level, from a defined region of interest, or through spatial or spectral aggregation. Supervised learning is then applied using conventional algorithms such as partial least squares regression or discrimination (PLS/PLSR), support vector machines and regression (SVM/SVR), and other statistical or kernel-based models. These models are commonly combined with dedicated spectral preprocessing techniques aimed at mitigating sensor noise and compensating for scattering and illumination variability. Widely used preprocessing methods include Savitzky--Golay smoothing, standard normal variate (SNV) normalization, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and derivative-based spectral transformations.

\medskip
\noindent
Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of such classical pipelines for non-destructive assessment of fruit quality attributes. For instance, hyperspectral data combined with PLSR and SVR models have been successfully used to estimate physicochemical properties of apples during storage following Savitzky--Golay filtering and SNV normalization \cite{agriculture13051086}. Similarly, PLS-based models employing tailored preprocessing strategies have achieved high accuracy for parameters such as soluble solids content, acidity, and phenolic compounds in apples, underscoring the strong dependence of classical ML performance on appropriate spectral normalization \cite{horticulturae8070598}.

\medskip
\noindent
A major advantage of traditional ML approaches lies in their interpretability and their ability to identify informative wavelengths within the high-dimensional hyperspectral space. Consequently, feature extraction and wavelength selection techniques are frequently integrated into classical pipelines to reduce redundancy and computational complexity while preserving performance. Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), for example, has been employed to extract effective wavelength subsets and to construct reduced-band models suitable for fast and potentially real-time applications \cite{agriculture13051086}. Comparable results have been reported in pear quality assessment studies, where wavelength selection combined with LS-SVM and optimized preprocessing substantially improved model robustness and estimation accuracy \cite{foods13233956}. These findings are consistent with broader reviews emphasizing the central role of preprocessing and feature selection in traditional HSI-based learning frameworks \cite{RAM2024109037}.

\medskip
\noindent
Despite their proven effectiveness, traditional ML approaches are often evaluated under relatively controlled experimental conditions, such as laboratory or postharvest environments with standardized acquisition protocols. As a result, many existing studies focus on detection or quality estimation tasks based on already manifested spectral differences rather than on truly pre-symptomatic inference. Review studies further highlight persistent challenges in transferring HSI models from laboratory settings to real-world field deployment, including illumination variability, background complexity, sensor limitations, and domain shift effects \cite{RAM2024109037, su16146064}. Recent preharvest investigations demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved through careful band reduction and model design; however, they also reveal that robustness and generalization remain key obstacles for operational field applications \cite{c5ae649d7cf34cb7aaf3b08a25dbd79d}. Overall, prior work establishes traditional ML as a powerful and interpretable foundation for hyperspectral data analysis, while motivating methodological choices that explicitly address variability and scalability when targeting early and field-relevant inference tasks.


\subsection{Deep learning and non-linear models}

\noindent
Deep learning has also been widely explored for hyperspectral learning, including spectral-only networks that operate on one-dimensional signatures and spectral--spatial architectures that learn jointly from local patches or full cubes. Such models can exploit non-linear structure and spatial context without requiring hand-crafted features, and they have shown strong performance in benchmark hyperspectral classification settings \cite{Chen2024MutationHSI}.

\medskip
\noindent
In practice, however, hyperspectral deep learning in agriculture faces the same fundamental constraints highlighted for CV more broadly (Section~\ref{subsec:cv_ai_agriculture}): limited labeled data, expensive annotations (especially for pixel-level segmentation), and acquisition-dependent domain shift. These issues are amplified by the high dimensionality and inter-band correlation of hyperspectral data, which can increase overfitting risk and reduce transferability across scenes and seasons. Consequently, recent reviews emphasize that classical pipelines---combining explicit spectral preprocessing, interpretable models, and wavelength selection---remain competitive and operationally attractive for small- to medium-scale agricultural datasets \cite{RAM2024109037, su16146064, ATTRI2023102217}.


\subsection{Pixel-level versus image-level modeling paradigms}

\noindent

In hyperspectral image analysis, the choice of representation unit plays a central role in determining both the sensitivity of models to localized changes and their robustness under real-world conditions. Hyperspectral data are inherently acquired at the pixel level, where each pixel is represented as a high-dimensional spectral vector spanning contiguous wavelength channels. Pixel-level modeling directly exploits this representation and enables fine-grained discrimination of material properties and subtle biochemical variations, which can be critical for detecting early stress signals or micro-scale defects.

\medskip
\noindent
Despite these advantages, pixel-level approaches face substantial practical limitations. Pixel-wise classification or inference typically requires dense and accurate pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain in agricultural contexts. Moreover, pixel-based outputs are often sensitive to noise, mixed pixels, and background variability, particularly under non-uniform illumination and complex field conditions. To address these challenges, many modern hyperspectral methods incorporate spectral--spatial strategies that aggregate information across local neighborhoods using patch-based, region-based, or superpixel representations. By integrating spatial context with spectral information, such approaches reduce sensitivity to pixel-level inconsistencies and often achieve improved robustness and generalization \cite{Chen2024MutationHSI}.

\medskip
\noindent
By contrast, image-level modeling treats the entire hyperspectral cube or large spatial regions as holistic inputs to machine learning models, thereby simplifying annotation requirements and enabling global context to inform decisions. While image-level approaches may be less sensitive to highly localized early anomalies, they benefit from reduced labeling effort and increased stability under variable acquisition conditions. Recent empirical evaluations further highlight that the incorporation of spatial context is a key factor in achieving reliable and generalizable performance in deep learning-based hyperspectral classification \cite{Chen2024MutationHSI}. Overall, the trade-offs between pixel-level, spectral--spatial, and image-level modeling paradigms reflect fundamental balances between spatial granularity, label efficiency, and operational robustness in hyperspectral applications.




\subsection{Challenges: class imbalance, background clutter, and generalization}

\noindent
Field-deployable hyperspectral learning systems must cope with several interacting sources of error. First, class distributions are often highly imbalanced (e.g., early defects occupy a small fraction of pixels), which can bias learners and destabilize threshold-based decision rules. Second, background clutter and mixed pixels are common in vineyard imagery, where leaves, wood, soil, and artificial materials may introduce confounding spectra and spatial edge effects. Third, acquisition variability (illumination, viewing geometry, and sensor-specific noise characteristics) produces domain shift that degrades model transfer from controlled conditions to operational settings \cite{RAM2024109037, su16146064}. These challenges are particularly severe for pixel-level segmentation, where dense labeling is costly and small spatial errors can propagate into unreliable image-level decisions.

\medskip
\noindent
While the modeling strategies reviewed above span a wide range of algorithms and data representations, their application in fruit analysis literature can be broadly divided into two conceptual objectives: (i) the detection of existing, observable defects or quality attributes, and (ii) the early identification of latent physiological disorders prior to visible manifestation. The following section reviews prior work in both domains, with particular emphasis on hyperspectral approaches for fruit defect detection and early-stage, pre-symptomatic detection.

\section{Related Work on Fruit Defect Detection and Early-Stage Detection}

\noindent
Previous studies applying hyperspectral imaging to fruit quality analysis have addressed both defect detection and early-stage, pre-symptomatic detection, although these objectives are often treated implicitly rather than explicitly. In the context of this review, detection refers to the identification of defects that are already visually or structurally manifested, whereas early-stage detection denotes the identification of pre-symptomatic or latent conditions that precede visible damage.

\subsection{HSI-based detection of visible fruit defects}

\noindent
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a well-established non-destructive technique for detecting
visible fruit defects, including skin blemishes, decay, and mechanical injuries, particularly
in postharvest inspection and grading applications. By combining high spectral resolution
with spatial information, HSI enables effective discrimination between healthy and defective
tissues based on characteristic reflectance differences associated with structural damage,
biochemical changes, or pathogen activity.

\medskip
\noindent
Numerous studies demonstrate the effectiveness of classical hyperspectral analysis pipelines
for visible defect detection. Wang et al.~\cite{app13053279} employed hyperspectral imaging
together with spectral preprocessing and wavelength selection methods (CARS and SPA)
to classify natural skin defects in \textit{Cerasus humilis} fruit. Their approach achieved high
classification accuracy and enabled spatial localization of defective regions, highlighting
the importance of integrating spectral discrimination with image-level analysis. These
findings are consistent with broader reviews showing that Vis/NIR spectroscopy and
hyperspectral techniques are robust tools for identifying surface degradation across diverse
fruit types under controlled conditions \cite{agriculture15202167}.

\medskip
\noindent
Beyond surface-level defects, hyperspectral imaging has also been applied to the detection
of decay processes during postharvest storage. Min et al.~\cite{min2023decay} reviewed
recent advances in early decay detection using hyperspectral imaging, demonstrating that
HSI can capture spectral changes associated with fungal infection before severe tissue
degradation becomes visually apparent. Nevertheless, most reported applications focus on
monitoring ongoing decay during storage rather than on identifying latent physiological
disorders prior to visible symptom development.

\medskip
\noindent
Comprehensive reviews further confirm the maturity of hyperspectral imaging as a quality
assessment tool within the fruit and vegetable supply chain. Vignati et al.~\cite{app13179740}
summarized key concepts, data processing strategies, and applications of HSI for quality
monitoring, emphasizing its effectiveness for defect detection and postharvest inspection,
while also noting limitations related to environmental variability and model transferability.

\medskip
\noindent
Overall, existing literature establishes hyperspectral imaging as a reliable and powerful
technology for detecting visible fruit defects and postharvest decay under controlled
acquisition conditions. However, the majority of these studies address defects that are
already externally or structurally expressed, thereby motivating further research toward
pre-symptomatic detection frameworks capable of identifying latent physiological changes
prior to visible manifestation, particularly under realistic field conditions.

\subsection{Attempts Toward Early and Pre-Symptomatic Defect Detection}

\noindent
Several investigations have demonstrated that HSI can reveal latent internal disorders
before external manifestation. Dong et al.~\cite{DONG2025101166} showed that early-stage
bitter pit in apples can be identified using VIS--NIR hyperspectral data combined with
spectral and texture features, achieving high classification accuracy prior to visible pit
formation. This highlights the capacity of HSI to detect internal physiological imbalances
before macroscopic damage occurs.

\medskip
\noindent
Pre-symptomatic detection of pathogen infection has also been reported across multiple
crops. Haghbin et al.~\cite{haghbin2023non} demonstrated that gray mold infection in
kiwifruit can be identified using hyperspectral data and chemometric models, capturing
infection-related spectral changes before visible decay appears. Similarly, hyperspectral
imaging enabled early detection of anthracnose in pear leaves through multi-source feature
fusion~\cite{zhang2024early}, as well as the identification of bacterial leaf spot in tomato
prior to symptom development~\cite{zhang2024hyperspectral}.

\medskip
\noindent
Recent advancements have further integrated HSI with deep learning to enhance sensitivity
to subtle stress-related patterns. Ou et al.~\cite{ou2024hyperspectral} combined HSI with
deep neural networks for the early detection of gray mold in strawberry leaves, identifying
spectral signatures associated with initial pathogen stress.

\medskip
\noindent
Despite these results, most early-detection studies remain limited to controlled environments
and localized leaf- or fruit-level analysis. Truly field-ready frameworks that provide early-warning
signals ahead of defect emergence under realistic, field-scale vineyard conditions remain scarce. This
underscores the need for methodologies that combine field-acquired hyperspectral data with robust
preprocessing, wavelength reduction, and image-level aggregation to deliver practical, pre-symptomatic
early-warning screening in real-world agricultural settings.


\subsection{Limitations of Existing Approaches under Field Conditions}

\noindent
Despite the substantial progress demonstrated by hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in fruit
quality assessment and early defect detection, the majority of existing approaches remain
challenged by limited applicability under real-world field conditions. Most studies are
conducted in controlled laboratory or postharvest environments, where illumination,
background, viewing geometry, and acquisition timing are carefully regulated. While such
settings facilitate methodological development and performance benchmarking, they do
not adequately reflect the complexity and variability encountered in operational orchard
or vineyard scenarios.

\medskip
\noindent
Several reviews emphasize that environmental variability represents a major obstacle
for field deployment of HSI systems. Vignati et al.~\cite{app13179740} note that changes
in ambient lighting, surface moisture, temperature, and background composition can
significantly distort spectral signatures, reducing model robustness and transferability.
Similarly, Wang et al.~\cite{agriculture15202167} highlight that Vis/NIR-based fruit quality
models often exhibit degraded performance when transferred across seasons, cultivars,
or acquisition setups, necessitating frequent recalibration.

\medskip
\noindent
Another key limitation lies in data annotation and scalability. Many HSI-based studies
rely on dense pixel-level or region-level labeling, which is labor-intensive, subjective,
and difficult to obtain consistently under field conditions. This constraint is particularly
pronounced in early-detection studies, where pre-symptomatic changes are subtle and
often lack clear visual reference points for annotation. As a result, most early-detection
experiments remain restricted to localized fruit- or leaf-level samples acquired under
controlled conditions~\cite{haghbin2023non,zhang2024early}.

\medskip
\noindent
Variability across acquisition conditions further complicates field deployment. Even when hyperspectral
signatures are informative under controlled settings \cite{min2023decay}, preharvest field operation introduces
additional sources of uncertainty related to illumination, background composition, plant phenology, weather
dynamics, and management practices, all of which can distort spectra and induce domain shift.

\medskip
\noindent
Finally, while recent studies have explored the integration of deep learning with HSI to
enhance sensitivity to subtle stress patterns, these approaches remain data-intensive and
highly task-specific. Deep learning models typically require large, consistently labeled
datasets that are rarely available in agricultural field contexts, limiting their
generalizability and operational feasibility~\cite{ou2024hyperspectral}. Consequently,
most existing frameworks prioritize detection of already manifested defects or localized
early symptoms, rather than robust, pre-symptomatic early-warning screening at field scale.

\medskip
\noindent
Collectively, these limitations indicate that although HSI is a powerful sensing modality,
current methodologies fall short of enabling reliable early warning of fruit disorders
under realistic field conditions. Addressing environmental variability, annotation
constraints, and model transferability remains essential for advancing HSI-based systems
from experimental studies toward practical, field-deployable early warning tools.

\medskip
\noindent
Taken together, the literature provides strong evidence that hyperspectral signatures can reveal latent physiological change, but field-scale early-warning frameworks for latent disorders remain scarce under realistic acquisition variability \cite{app13179740, agriculture15202167, RAM2024109037, su16146064}. This gap motivates field-ready single-acquisition screening pipelines that (i) reduce spectral redundancy through wavelength selection and (ii) aggregate pixel-level decisions into conservative scene- or cluster-level outputs that are more robust to background clutter and illumination variability.

\section{Research Gap and Study Positioning}

\subsection{Summary of Established Knowledge}
\label{subsec:gap_summary}

\noindent
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been extensively investigated as a non-destructive tool
for agricultural monitoring, particularly for the detection of visible defects, postharvest
decay, and quality-related attributes in fruits and vegetables. Numerous studies have
demonstrated that spectral and spectral--spatial features can effectively discriminate
between healthy and defective tissues, quantify physicochemical properties, and support
automated grading and sorting processes.

\medskip
\noindent
In parallel, the physiological and biomechanical mechanisms underlying fruit cracking
have been widely studied using destructive measurements, biochemical assays, and
controlled experiments. These studies have established the roles of cuticle integrity,
cell wall composition, water relations, and hormonal regulation in crack development,
providing valuable biological insight into cracking susceptibility.

Despite this extensive body of work, the integration of hyperspectral imaging with
physiological knowledge of cracking remains limited. In particular, while HSI has proven
effective for detecting existing defects, its use for providing early-warning insight into
a physiological disorder such as grape berry cracking—based on early spectral trends
under realistic field acquisition variability—remains largely unexplored.

\subsection{Identified Methodological and Application Gaps}
\label{subsec:gap_methods}

\noindent
A central gap in the existing literature lies in the focus on reactive rather than proactive
screening frameworks. Most hyperspectral studies in fruit analysis are designed to identify defects
or diseases after they have already manifested visually or structurally. Even studies
described as ``early detection'' typically operate at a stage where symptoms are already
incipient or localized, rather than truly pre-symptomatic.

\medskip
\noindent
Methodologically, many existing approaches rely on high-dimensional spectral data
without explicitly addressing spectral redundancy or computational efficiency. While
feature selection and wavelength reduction techniques have been applied in quality
assessment tasks, they are rarely integrated into end-to-end field workflows to support early
warning. Moreover, most models are trained and evaluated under controlled laboratory
or postharvest conditions, limiting their robustness and transferability to preharvest field
environments characterized by variable illumination, background complexity, and plant
heterogeneity.


\medskip
\noindent
From an application perspective, there is a notable lack of non-destructive tools capable
of providing actionable early warnings for physiological disorders in fruit crops. In the
context of table grapes, cracking is typically identified only after visible damage occurs,
at which point economic loss is often unavoidable. Existing scouting and inspection strategies therefore
do not support timely intervention or informed decision-making at the vineyard level.

\subsection{Lack of Early, Non-Destructive Crack Early-Warning Frameworks}
\label{subsec:gap_early_warning}

\noindent
Although grape cracking has been extensively studied from a physiological and
mechanistic standpoint, few studies have attempted to detect cracking at an
early stage using optical sensing techniques. In particular, the detection of pre-symptomatic
microcracks or latent physiological stress—prior to visible skin rupture—remains largely
unaddressed in the literature.

\medskip
\noindent
This gap reflects both technical and conceptual challenges. Pre-symptomatic cracking is
characterized by subtle structural and biochemical changes that do not produce obvious
visual cues, making traditional imaging approaches insufficient. Furthermore, the lack of
dense, consistently labeled hyperspectral datasets acquired under field conditions has limited
the development of models capable of learning early spectral signatures associated with cracking susceptibility.

\medskip
\noindent
As a result, no established framework currently exists that combines non-destructive
hyperspectral imaging, machine learning, and field-ready image-level aggregation to deliver field-ready
early warnings for grape cracking before it becomes visually apparent.

\subsection{Positioning of the Present Study within the Literature}
\label{subsec:gap_positioning}

\noindent


The present study is positioned at the intersection of physiological research on grape
cracking and applied hyperspectral data analysis. By leveraging VIS--NIR hyperspectral
imaging, machine learning, and spectral feature selection, this work aims to move beyond
defect detection toward field-relevant early-warning screening of cracking susceptibility.

\medskip
\noindent
Specifically, the proposed approach integrates efficient wavelength selection with pixel-level
classification and spatial aggregation to capture subtle changes in berry skin integrity and
physiological state prior to visible cracking. Unlike prior studies that focus on postharvest
or controlled acquisition, this work emphasizes early-stage, preharvest screening under realistic field
conditions.

\medskip
\noindent
In doing so, this study bridges a critical gap between fundamental understanding of
cracking mechanisms and practical, non-destructive vineyard screening. The resulting
framework contributes a novel perspective to the literature by explicitly addressing the
connection between pixel-level spectral classification and whole-image decision support through spatial aggregation and by demonstrating the feasibility of
hyperspectral imaging as an early warning tool for grape cracking.
